## About

[Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) is an open-source collection of tutorials, articles, datasets and other resources for creating useful, interesting, artistic and friendly online bots -- _smart software agents that do fun or useful stuff_ -- for [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and other online networks.

[Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) also lets you browse these bots by various categories, such as:

- [Twitter bots](https://botwiki.org/bots/twitterbots)
- [game bots](https://botwiki.org/tag/game)
- [open source bots for Slack written with node.js](https://botwiki.org/tag/opensource+nodejs+slack)

and [more](https://botwiki.org/bots/).


## Contributing to Botwiki

Botwiki is powered by [Pico](http://picocms.org/) ([official documentation](http://picocms.org/docs.html)), which is a very simple CMS running on PHP. It uses the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templating language. The content of the site is created with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

There is a few ways you can contribute to Botwiki. 


### Reporting issues

If you see an error on any of the pages, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/issues) where you describe the problem and if you know, you can also suggest a solution.

### Adding a new bot

To add a new bot, you have a few options.

The easiest way is to use the submission form at [botwiki.org/submit-your-bot](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot). After filling out the information, your bot will be added to the queue for manual review.

Another option is to send a pull request to this repo.

Things you will need to install and be/get familiar with:

- [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
- [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (no need to install anything here)

The above will be fine if you want to use a site like [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/) to preview your updates. You can use this site to see if your Markdown text looks okay, check if links are working -- but you won't be able to see images.

So, start by cloning the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:botwiki/botwiki.org.git
```

All the content is inside the  `content` folder. Let's see how we'd go about adding a new Twitter bot called "_my_new_bot_"

The structure of the file is very simple, here's an example from the Twitter bot that posts about holidays for each day.

```
/*
Title: @holidaybot4000
Description: Every day IS a holiday
Author: Stefan Bohacek
Date: July 21, 2015
Tags: twitter,twitterbot,active,node.js,nodejs,node,holidays,images,flags,useful,fourtonfish

Nav: hidden
Robots: index,follow
*/

[![](/content/bots/twitterbots/images/holidaybot4000.png)](https://twitter.com/holidaybot4000)

[@holidaybot4000](https://twitter.com/holidaybot4000) is a Twitter bot that tweets holidays around the world for the given day, typically together with an image of the country's flag. It was created by [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish).
```

The `Title` should be the name of the bot. I include the "@" for bots on Twitter. The `Description` should be short and it shows up on the search page or when you browse the content of the site by tags.

The `Author` should be your name (or Twitter handle, or your _stage name_), as the author of the page. (Although, I don't think this shows up anywhere right now.)

`Date` will be today's date. It should also be updated in case you're doing a major change to an existing page.

I recommend as many useful tags as possible. You can browse the website or open some of the files to see what some common tags are, but be sure to include whether the bot is `active` or `inactive`, some basic keywords, for example `images` if the bot posts or handles images in any way, and if the bot has publicly available source code, be sure to include the `open source` and `opensource` tags. (This is necessary due to the [limitations of the search feature](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/issues/19).)

You can keep the `Nav` and `Robots` values as they are. `Nav: hidden` just means that the bot won't show up in the main navigation, like the _About_, _Bots_, _Tutorials_, etc pages.

Now, you will also need to go to your bot's page and take a screenshot that shows how the bot works. There is no set requirement for the height, since every bot may need different amount of space to show what it does, but the width should be **900px**.

The screenshot must be in the `.png` format and also needs to match the name of the bot used for the page `Title`. If you have spaces in your `Title`, change them to `_` in the image file name.

The screenshot itself should be in the `images` folder inside the folder where you added your bot. I also recommend downloading a program like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) (OSX) or [Trimage](http://trimage.org/) (Linux, Windows, OSX) to optimize the size of the image.

You can then use [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/) to check if the content of your .md file renders correctly. If everything looks good, go ahead and open a pull request so that your updates can be reviewed and merged.

### Adding a new bot with Botwiki running on your computer

If you prefer to run the site on your computer, you will also need:

- [php](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)


After cloning the project:

```
cd botwiki.org
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

Make sure everything installs correctly, otherwise you will see an error that looks like this:

```
Class 'ParsedownExtra' not found in /home/stefan/Desktop/Untitled Folder/botwiki.org/lib/pico.php on line 152
```

To run the site on our local machine:

```
php -S localhost:5000
```

(The port number, which is `5000` here, can be pretty much any number.)

Then, we will go to the `content/bots/twitterbots` folder. We can make a copy of one of the files and rename it to `my_new_bot.md`.

Once you're done, you will be able to go to `localhost:5000/bots/twitterbots/my_new_bot` and see your newly added bot.

## Updating the website's style

If you want to mess with the look of the site, you will need to also install [node](https://nodejs.org/) (which comes with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)).

Then, from the root directory, you can run:

```
sudo npm install
```


First run the site as above:

```
php -S localhost:5000
```

And then (in a new terminal window) run the gulp tasks, simply with:

```
gulp
```

The site will be available with live-reloading at `http://localhost:3000`.

If you for some reason get an error about a node package missing, just install it with

```
sudo npm install NAME_OF_THE_PACKAGE --save-dev
```
